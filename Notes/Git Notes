#Rails notes
rails console           open rails console
Car.connection          opens connection to cars database
car = Car.all           this selects * from table car
car = Car.count         this counts number of entries in table
Car.all.limit(1)        this pulls the list but limits the results to 1
rails s -b 0.0.0.0      deploys current application live, might need bundle install first
